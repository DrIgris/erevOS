# erevOS
Beginner operating system named after the greek god of the dark. After getting it to a functional OS(kernel and shell) I plan to work on optimization and creating localized pitfalls in the filesystem to prevent scraping from malicious sources. From there, ideally start the arduous journey of creating a somewhat usable GUI.

FUTURE PLANS:
  Optimization
  ext4 File System
  GUI
